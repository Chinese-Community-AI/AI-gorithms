Welcome to the foundation. This section is designed to give you a structural understanding of the tools we'll use throughout the roadmap.

## 🐣 If you are a complete beginner

Our focus is on **structure, templates, and patterns**. At this stage, your goal is to build a mental map. Don't worry about mastering every implementation detail yet—focus on understanding _what_ each structure does and _why_ it exists.

## 🚀 If you already have some foundation

Use this section as a high-speed recap. If you already understand these concepts, a quick scan is enough. You don't need deep mastery to move forward—those skills will sharpen as we apply patterns to real problems.

## 💡 Pro Tip: The "Nap" Strategy

If a concept feels like a brick wall, **skip it**.
Coding intuition often develops in the background. Take a break, get some sleep, and revisit it later. You'll be surprised how often things click on the second pass.
