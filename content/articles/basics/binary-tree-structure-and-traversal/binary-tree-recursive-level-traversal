## One Sentence Summary 
There are only two ways to traverse a binary tree: recursive traversal and level-order traversal. 
1. Recursive traversal leads to DFS algorithms. 
2. Level-order traversal leads to BFS algorithms.

The order of recursive traversal in a binary tree is fixed, but there are three key places to insert code. Placing code in different positions will produce different effects. 
The order of level-order traversal is also fixed, but there are three different ways to write it, suitable for different situations. 

Binary Tree Traversal: 
-Recursive Traversal (DFS) Three special positions, code runs at different times
-Level-order Traveral (BFS) Three different ways, for different scenarios 

Recursive Traversal (DFS): 
- Preorder position 
- Inorder postion 
- Postorder position 

Level-order Travesal (BFS): 
- First way is the simplest cannot record depth 
- Second way is most common can record depth 
- Third way is the most flexible Good for complex problems 

After learning basic concepts of binary trees and special types of binary trees, this article will show you how to traverse and visi nodes in a binary tree.
There are two main traversal algorithms for binary trees: recursive traversal and level-order traversal. Each has a code template. The recursive template can be used for later DFS and backtracking algorithms. The level-order template can be used for BFS algorithms. That's why I often say binary tree structures are very important. 

Preorder, inorder, and postorder traverals are all recursive traversals. The difference is just where you put your custom code in the template. This will be explained with visual panel. 

## Recursive Traversal (DFS) 
Here is the code template for recursive traveral of a binary tree: 

```python
#basic binary tree node 
class TreeNode: 
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

# recursive traversal framework for binary tree
def traverse(root: TreeNode):

    if root is None:
        return 

    traverse(root.left)
    traverse(root.right)
```
Why can this short and simple code traverse a binary tree? In what order does it visit the nodes?
You can think of the traverse recursive function as a pointer moving around the binary tree.
