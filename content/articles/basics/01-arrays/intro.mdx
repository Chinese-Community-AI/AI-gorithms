# Introduction to Arrays

Arrays are the most basic and fundamental way to store a collection of data in a computer's memory. If you understand how a post office box system works, you already understand Arrays.

## What is an Array?

In technical terms, an array is a **contiguous** block of memory. This means all the elements are stored right next to each other, like a row of lockers in a hallway.

### Key Characteristics

- **Fixed Size:** Traditionally, arrays have a fixed size defined at creation.
- **Contiguous Memory:** Every element is adjacent to the next.
- **Index-Based:** We access elements using their numerical position (starting from 0).

## Why Use Arrays?

The "Superpower" of the array is **Random Access**.

Because the computer knows exactly where the first element is and how big each element is, it can calculate the memory address of _any_ element instantly using math:
`Address = Start + (Index * Size)`

> This gives us **O(1) Time Complexity** for reading any element, no matter how large the array is.

## Core Operations

| Operation     | Time Complexity | Why?                                                   |
| :------------ | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access**    | O(1)            | Direct math calculation to memory address.             |
| **Search**    | O(n)            | Might have to check every element one by one.          |
| **Insertion** | O(n)            | Need to shift all subsequent elements to make room.    |
| **Deletion**  | O(n)            | Need to shift all subsequent elements to fill the gap. |
