A **data structure** is a way to store data in computer memory. Memory stores data as bits, which are zeros and ones. Elements are placed one after another in order. Each element gets an address, and these addresses increase based on how much space each element needs.

The word "array" can mean different things depending on the language you use. To make things easier, we'll divide them into two main types: **static** and **dynamic**.

## Static Arrays

A static array is a fixed block of continuous memory. You access elements directly using an index. This is the most fundamental form of an array.

## Dynamic Arrays

Dynamic arrays are designed for convenience. They add useful tools—like `push`, `insert`, and `remove`—on top of static arrays so you can easily modify data without writing extra logic.

## Our Goal

In this section, we will use a basic static array to build our own dynamic array from scratch. By implementing common actions like adding, deleting, and updating, you'll learn exactly how built-in data structures work under the hood.

This foundation will help you build more complex structures later, like stacks, queues, and hash tables.
