The word "array" can mean different things depending on the language you use. To make things easier, we'll divide them into two main types: **static** and **dynamic**.

## Static Arrays

A static array is a fixed block of continuous memory. You access elements directly using an index. This is the most fundamental form of an array.

## Dynamic Arrays

Dynamic arrays are designed for convenience. They add useful tools—like `push`, `insert`, and `remove`—on top of static arrays so you can easily modify data without writing extra logic.

## Our Goal

In this section, we will use a basic static array to build our own dynamic array from scratch. By implementing common actions like adding, deleting, and updating, you'll learn exactly how built-in data structures work under the hood.

This foundation will help you build more complex structures later, like stacks, queues, and hash tables.
