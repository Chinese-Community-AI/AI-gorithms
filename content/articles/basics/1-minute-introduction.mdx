This section covers the fundamental tools you will use throughout the roadmap.

## For beginners

Focus on **structure and patterns**. Your goal is to understand what each tool does and why it is useful. Do not worry about small details yet—you will master them as you practice.

## For experienced learners

Use this section as a quick review. If you already know these concepts, a fast scan is enough. You can move forward once you have a general understanding.

## Tip: The "Nap" Strategy

If a topic is difficult, **skip it**.
Learning often happens when you are not thinking about it. Take a break, sleep on it, and come back later. Concepts usually make more sense the second time around.
