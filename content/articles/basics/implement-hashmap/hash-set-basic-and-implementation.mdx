When I explain each data structure, I usually separate the principle and code implementation into two articles. However, for the hash set, both the principles and implementation are discussed in this single article. Doesn't that seem strange?
Well, that' becasue there's not much to say about hash sets. They are basically just a simple wrap around hash tables: The keys in a hash table are essentially a hash set.
That sums it up in one sentence, but let's go into a big more detail to give hash set their due respect.

## How Hash Set Works
The main use of a hash set is to remove duplicates. Its features are: no duplicate elements, you can add or remove elements in O(1) time,
and you can check if an element exists in O(1) time.

```python
class HashSet:
    #Add, add an element to the hash set, complexity O(1)
    # If the element already exists, nothing happens 
    def add(self, key: int) -> None:
        pass 
    
    # Remove, remove an element from the hash set, complexity O(1)
    # If the element does not exist, nothing happens 
    def remove(self, key: int) -> None:
        pass 
    
    # Check, determine if an element exists, complexity O(1)
    def contains(self, key: int) -> bool:
        pass 
```

How are these APIs implemented? Actually, you don't need to implement them yourself. Just use the hash table we introduced before.
When you insert a key-value pair with put(key, value) into a hash table, the time complexity is O(1).
When you remove a key with remove(key), it is also O(1). To check if a key exists, just see if get(key) returns null. This is also O(1).

So the APIs for hash set can be directly implemented by reusing the hash table's APIs. When you use a hash set, you are really just using the keys of a hash table.

You may ask, what about the value in the hash table? You can simmply ignore it. We can use a placeholder value. You will understand this when you see the code. 

Although a hash set is just a simple wrapper around a hash table, most programming languages provide a built-in hash set data structure, like set in Python, HashSet in Java, and unordered_set in C++. But in Go, the standard library does not provide a hash set.
If you want to use a hash set in Go, you need to use a hash map with map to simulate it.

Important:
Because a hash set stores elements as keys in a hash table, hash set and hash table have the same restrictions. For example you cannot reply on the order of elements in a hash set, and the elements in a hash set should be immutable.
For more details, see Hash Table Features and Principles. 

Hash Set Code Example 
With the explanation above, the code should be very easy to write. Since it is so simple, I will only show a Java Implementation. 
For other languages, you can use the built-in hash set or wrap your own hash table as a hash set: 
```python 
class MyHashSet: 
    def __init__(self):
        # underlying dictionary to store set elements 
        self.map = {} 
    
    def add(self, key):
        # add a key-value pair to the hash table, using True as placeholder 
        self.map[key] = True 
    
    def remove(self, key):
        # remove the key from the hash table
        if key in self.map:
            del self.map[key] 
    
    def contains(self, key):
        # check if the hash table contains the key 
        retur key in self.map 
    
    def size(self):
        return len(self.map) 

```
