In the previous article Core Pinciples of Hash Tables, I introduced the core principles and key concepts
of hash tables. It mentioned that there are mainly two methods to resolve hash collisions:
chaining and linear probing (also known as open addressing):

Since linear probing is a bit more complex, this article will first explain several challenges in implementing linear probing, and the next article will provide the actual code implementation.

## Simplified Scenario
The previously introduced chaining method is relatively straightforward, where each element in the table is a linked list, and when a hash collison occurs, you simply insert the element into the list.

Linear probing is more complex, primarily due to two challenges that invlove various array operation techniques. Before clarifying these challenges, let's establish a simplifed scenario:

Assume our hash table only supports key and value types as int, with a fixed table.length of 10, and the hash function implemented as hash(key) = key % 10. This setup easily simulates hash collisions, such as both hash(1) and hash(11) resulting in 1.

The general logic of linear probing is as follows:
