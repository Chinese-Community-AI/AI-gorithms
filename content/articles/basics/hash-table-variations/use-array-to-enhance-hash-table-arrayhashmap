In the previous chapter enhancing hash tables with linekd list, we used doubly linked lists to enhance 
hash tables, implementing a data structure like LinkedHashMap that maintains the insertion order of keys in a hash table.
Linked list can enhance hash tables, and arrays, being good siblings to linked lists, can also enhance hash tables. 

## Adding randomKey() API 
Now, there's a chalenge: based on the standardd hash table API, add a new randomKey() API that can 
return a random key in O(1) time complexity:
